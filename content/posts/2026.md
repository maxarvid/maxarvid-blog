Somehow, 2025 returned. To make 2026 a little bit less like 2025, I want to spend more time recording the nice parths of programming rather than just work. 2025 was eaten up by work and travel in both wonderful and challenging ways.

To this end, and to be accountable to myself, I will keep track of a personal project, TightShip. During 2025 I flipped and flopped towards what stack to use... Since I've been helping friends and colleagues with projects they've prompted forth using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), I thought that I really ought to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), which I've been fond of since before Lovable picked it as its backend.

Supabase is amazing, but ultimately it boils down to the following: Will I have more fun configuring Supabase or building out a minimal server using a Node framework like [Hono](https://hono.dev/)? Leading question, so you can probably guess where my heart lies. More to come.
